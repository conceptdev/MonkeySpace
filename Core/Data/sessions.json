Ability (or activity) based authorization provides a more flexible and maintainable approach to the traditional .NET authorization technique. Hero decouples the permissions and the code. By associating a role to a method or action in .NET (through typical Authorization attribute) a tight coupling between a role and an action is created. However, what happens when a role name changes? What if new roles are added? Now all code that references that role must be updated. Instead, if ability names are assigned to an action or method the functionality and the permissions are abstracted. This allows for a loose coupling between functionality and roles/users. When the user and roles requirements change only one section of code needs to be updated rather than going through the entire project updating those tight couplings. Permissions are effectively encapsulated within a single, refactorable file similar to the ability.rb in CanCan.","speakers":[{"id":34,"name":"Eric LaForce","twitterHandle":"elaforc","bio":"Eric is a lead software developer at a custom development shop in Charlotte, NC called Skookum Digital Works.

Rather than requiring complex frameworks and boilerplate, Clacks servers and clients are built by fluently defining commands and attaching lambdas for handling requests and responses. Clacks uses an ASCII/binary protocol inspired by memcache and can easily handle thousands of requests per second. In this talk we will build a client/server application from scratch, show how other technology stacks can easily interoperate with this server, and show how MindTouch uses Clacks in production for its cloud based self-service help center and knowledge-as-a-service platform.","speakers":[{"id":41,"name":"Arne Claassen","twitterHandle":"sdether","bio":"Arne Claassen is a senior software developer at MindTouch and the lead developer for Dream, MindTouch's open source REST framework and MindTouch Clacks, MindTouch's open source RPC toolkit.

Once you've gone down the wrong path, it's much more difficult to re-architect your way out of trouble.

Attendees will see how these patterns map to API concepts in iOS and Android. Some cross-platform libraries will be specifically discussed, but the emphasis of the talk will be on higher-level architectural topics.","speakers":[{"id":42,"name":"Larry O'Brien","twitterHandle":"lobrien","bio":"Larry O'Brien is a Developer Evangelist for Xamarin.
